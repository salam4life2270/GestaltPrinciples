# GestaltPrinciples
Proximity:
I followed the gestalt principle of proximity to group similar related items together in the About us,Menu, Our location and Reservation. The white space also creates a good contrast for good user interface.

Similarity:
I applied similarity in the texts and images part and place the together.

Continuation:
The continuation principle was applied with the header elements as well as the footer elements containing the phone number, opening time and the social media icons.


Closure:
The closur principle is applied atnthe social media icons in my design

Figure/ground:
My foreground texts and images are more prominent and visible with the bbackground. i used the contrast checker to have good contrast and visual tension.


Symmetry:
I tried to apply the symmetry principle by making my images and texts block of the same size on the first page. On the second page, the first two images placed adjacent to each other are of complimentary halves.

Common Fate:
The picture galerry follows the common fate principle because it helps with grouping relevant photos in the gallery.

Common region:
This applies to the picture gallery, footer section as well as the header sectionbelow the first photo on the first page.
